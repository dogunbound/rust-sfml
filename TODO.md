# DESCRIPTION

A list of missing crap that needs to be done... at some point.

Also, just because something is not on this list and it seems like it is missing to you, doesn't mean it is not
missing! There may be more things todo that are not mentioned here! If you just want to add onto the TODO list,
just make a PR. What would be more appreciated is if you made a PR implementing it. If you do that, you MUST
include usage in the examples or write example doc code!

Thanks!

# Missing implementation

sfRenderWindow_drawVertexBufferRange
sfRenderwindow_createVulkanSurface
sfRenderTexture_drawVertexBufferRange
All of the vulkan crap
handleEvents

# Other stuff
window-test example crashes if you keep selecting new window sizes quickly on linux. (It also crashes in rust-sfml 2.6 versioning)
