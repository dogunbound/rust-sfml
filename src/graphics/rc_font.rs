/// Type for loading and manipulating character fonts. (reference counted)
///
/// Fonts can be loaded from a file, from memory or from a custom stream,
/// and supports the most common types of fonts.
///
/// See the [`from_file`] function for the complete list of supported formats.
///
/// [`from_file`]: RcFont::from_file
///
/// Once it is loaded, a `RcFont` instance provides three types of information about the font:
///
/// - Global metrics, such as the line spacing
/// - Per-glyph metrics, such as bounding box or kerning
/// - Pixel representation of glyphs
///
/// Fonts alone are not very useful: they hold the font data but cannot make anything useful of it.
/// To do so you need to use the [`RcText`] type, which is able to properly output text with
/// several options such as character size, style, color, position, rotation, etc.
/// This separation allows more flexibility and better performances:
/// indeed a `RcFont` is a heavy resource, and any operation on it is
/// slow (often too slow for real-time applications).
/// On the other side, a [`RcText`] is a lightweight object which can combine the
/// glyphs data and metrics of a `RcFont` to display any text on a render target.
/// Note that it is also possible to bind several [`RcText`] instances to the same `RcFont`.
///
/// It is important to note that the [`RcText`] instance doesn't copy the font that it uses,
/// it only keeps a reference to it.
/// Thus, a `RcFont` must not be destructed while it is used by a
/// [`RcText`] (i.e. never write a function that uses a local `RcFont` instance for creating a text).
///
/// Apart from loading font files, and passing them to instances of [`RcText`],
/// you should normally not have to deal directly with this type.
/// However, it may be useful to access the font metrics or rasterized glyphs for advanced usage.
///
/// Note that if the font is a bitmap font, it is not scalable,
/// thus not all requested sizes will be available to use.
/// This needs to be taken into consideration when using [`RcText`].
/// If you need to display text of a certain size, make sure the corresponding bitmap font that
/// supports that size is used.
