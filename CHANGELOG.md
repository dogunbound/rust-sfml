# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Removed

- Remove `Default` impl for clock because `Clock::start` can fail.

### Changed

- Rework `LoadResult` to `SfResult` as a more generic error type.
- Use `SfResult` in a lot of APIs that previously returned `Option`, `bool`, or panicked on error.

## 0.22.0

### Added

- Added `is_rgb` method for `Texture`, `RenderWindow`, and `RenderTexture`
- Add `RcTexture::raw_texture` to get the underlying `Texture` of an `RcTexture`
- Add direction arrow cursors from SFML 2.6 to `CursorType`
- Add `Scancode` API from SFML 2.6.
- Add tip about environment variables to README

### Changed

- `Image::set_pixel` and `Image::pixel_at` are now safe, checked functions. Added unsafe unchecked variants.
- Renamed `SetPixelError` to `PixelAccessError`
- Rust requirement bumped to 1.81
- Made `Context::get_function` a safe function

### Fixed

- Minor doc fixes, including typos
- Fixed compilation error on Windows MinGW

## 0.21.0

### SFML 2.6 update

rust-sfml 0.21 requires SFML 2.6. It will not work with 2.5.

### Added
- Added `RcFont` and `RcText` for reference counted text (see `examples/rc-resources.rs`)
- pub const DEFAULT for `Vertex`
- `is_smooth` and `set_smooth` methods for `Font`
- `RenderWindow::recreate` method to recreate a window with new parameters

### Changed
- Update `RcSprite` and `RcTexture` documentation.

### Fixed
- Missing `#include`s in CSFML
- Too restrictive lifetime for Music

## 0.20.0

### Added
- `Default` impl for `Color` (transparent)
- Help on using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for finding SFML shared libraries on *nix.
- `RcTexture` and `RcSprite` for reference counted textures (see `examples/rc-resources.rs`)

### Changed
- Removed `Sprite::disable_texture`, due to being an unsound API
- Methods that used to take `&Rect` now take `Rect` by value
- `listener::set_up_vector` now Takes `Vector3f` instead of `&Vector3f`
- Use `usize` instead of `u32` for `CustomShapePoints`
- Use `usize` instead of `u32` for `Shape` methods
- Use `usize` instead of `u32` in `CircleShape` and `ConvexShape` methods

### Internal improvements
- Remove needless raw conversion methods for Rect
- Remove needless raw conversion methods for Vector2/Vector3

## 0.19.0

### Added
- Basic support for statically linking SFML

### Fixed

- Wrong doc comment for RenderTexture::new
- Joystick axis was inacessible in the JoystickMoved event

### Changed
- `joystick::Axis` is now a proper enum

## 0.18.1

### Fixed
- Fix broken feature combinations (audio, graphics, system)

### Internal improvements
- Test non-default feature combinations in CI

## 0.18.0

### Added
- Examples for Vector3
- Examples for Vector2
- Examples for Rect
- Examples for RenderWindow
- Examples for Font
- Info about `SFML_INCLUDE_DIR` and `SFML_LIBS_DIR` environment variables

### Changed
- `window::clipboard::get_string()` now returns `String` instead of `&'static SfStr`
- `Color` now has public fields, removed the unnecessary getter/setter methods.

### Fixed
- Update requirements in the crate documentation
- Make `set_mouse_cursor` unsafe, as the cursor must stay alive while in use.
- Fix wrong `Vector3::{AddAssign, SubAssign}` impls
- Add `Hash` impl for `CursorType`
